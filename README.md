**Inspiration and Learning Journey**

Two months ago, I took Brad Traversy's ([https://github.com/bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)) Next.js course, where he built a property listing website called "PropertyPulse". Leveraging the valuable insights I gained, I decided to embark on my own learning journey by recreating the application using SvelteKit.

Through the development process, I encountered new challenges and broadened my skillset in data fetching, state management, routing, server side rendering, server side form validation, authentication and much more. I'm grateful to Brad Traversy for his contribution to my growth as a developer.
